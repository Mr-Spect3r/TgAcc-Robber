# Telegram Account Manager or Robber


This is a tool for creating and using a Telegram account session file! It depends on your thinking and work how to deal with this!

## File Session.py

Sounds interesting 

This source creates a session file using your Telegram account number! First it logs into my.Telegram and retrieves the api hash!

You can do a lot of bad things with this file!


# File Listener.py

As the name suggests

Its job is to log into the account through the session file and listen to messages! It shows you who sent what message to the account and when, and you can see it!


# File Robber.py

We have reached the exciting part of the story

This file is a Telegram account phishing tool

How does it work? 

This file comes from the user, gets the Telegram account number, the login code and the 2FA Pass, creates a session file and sends it to you! 




ohh, that's what we wanted! Now we can listen to the messages! We activate the listener and enter the victim's number in Telegram and receive the code! That's it! You are logged in!
