Sounds interesting 

This source creates a session file using your Telegram account number! First it logs into my.Telegram and retrieves the api hash!

You can do a lot of bad things with this file!


# File Listener.py

As the name suggests

Its job is to log into the account through the session file and listen to messages! It shows you who sent what message to the account and when, and you can see it!

We have reached the exciting part of the story

This file is a Telegram account phishing tool

How does it work?

This file comes from the user, takes the Telegram account number, login code and 2FA password, pretends to have encountered an error but has logged in!, creates a session file and sends it to you! After the file is sent to you, the chat will be deleted.

ohh, that's what we wanted! Now we can listen to the messages! We activate the listener and enter the victim's number in Telegram and receive the code! That's it! You are logged in!

Now all you have to do is encrypt this source using the "Encryption" tool and send it to your victims!
